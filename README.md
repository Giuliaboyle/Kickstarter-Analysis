# Visualizing Data Trends Using Excel

## Overview
### The client wants to determine the relationship between different theater campaign outcomes relative to their launch dates and fundraising goals in order to better structure her own theater campaign. 


## Purpose
### The purpose of this project was to develop tools for client to easily visualize important trends that may appear in her data set in order to draw conclusions for the development of her own campaign. 


## Analysis 
### The first graph compared the launch date to the theater outcomes. In order to do this I organized all of the theater outcome data along with the launch-date data into a pivot table. The pivot table was then convereted into a line graph in order to best visualize the trends.

### The second graph compared the campaign outcomes with the fundrasing goals.  In order to do this I compiled all of the theater outcome data along with the fundraising goal data to form a pivot table. The pivot table was then organized and convereted into a line graph in order to visualize the trends in the data.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
### The most difficult part of this project was determining the correct formulas to use to best display the data for the outcomes based on goal table. I decided to use an IFS statment forumla that contained many different conditionals. It was imperative to make sure that all of the formulas were adjusted properly to display the correct goal ranges. This task was very meticulous and took a lot of focus. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
