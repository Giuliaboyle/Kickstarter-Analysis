# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview
### My client Louise wants to determine the relationship between different theater campaign outcomes relative to their launch dates and fundraising goals in order to better structure her own theater campaign. 


## Purpose
### The purpose of this project was to develop tools for Louise to easily visualize important trends in her data set.


## Analysis and Challenges
### The first graph compared the launch date to the theater outcomes. In order to do this I organized all of the theater outcome data along with the launch-date data into a pivot table. The pivot table was then convereted into a line graph in order to best visualize the trends.

### The second graph compared the campaign outcomes with the fundrasing goals.  In order to do this I compiled all of the theater outcome data along with the fundraising goal data to form a pivot table. The pivot table was then organized and convereted into a line graph in order to visualize the trends in the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
