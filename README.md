# Visualizing Data Trends Using Excel

## Overview
### The client wants to determine the relationship between different theater campaign outcomes relative to their launch dates and fundraising goals in order to better structure her own campaign. 


## Purpose
### The purpose of this project was to develop tools for client to easily visualize important trends that may appear in her data set in order to draw conclusions for the development of her own campaign. 


## Analysis 
### The first graph compared the launch date to the theater outcomes. In order to do this I organized all of the theater outcome data along with the launch-date data into a pivot table. The pivot table was then converted into a line graph in order to best visualize the trends.

### The second graph compared the campaign outcomes with the fundraising goals.  In order to do this I compiled all of the theater outcome data along with the fundraising goal data to form a pivot table. The pivot table was then organized and converted into a line graph in order to visualize the trends in the data.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
### The most difficult part of this project was determining the correct formulas to use to best display the data for the outcomes based on goal table. I decided to use an IFS statement formula that contained many different conditionals. It was imperative to make sure that all the formulas were adjusted properly to display the correct goal ranges. This task was very meticulous and took a lot of focus. 


## Results

### The data from the first visual suggests that there is a strong trend in the data. We can see that the month of May had the most successful campaigns, but it also had the most failed campaigns. June and July also had very high success ratings compared to other months. This trend suggests that the best time for the client to launch a theater campaign would be in May, June, or July and the worst month for the client to launch a theater campaign would be December. 

### The data from the second visual suggests that there is also a strong relationship between the fundraising goal and the outcome of the campaign. The trend suggests that as the fundraising goal increases the more failed campaigns there are. Campaigns with lower fundraising goals had the most successful outcomes except for a few. 

### Although the data does allow us to see trends there may be a possible limitation in this data. We only looked at a fraction of the data we were presented with to draw these conclusions. We only focused on theater campaigns in this project, in a future when more time was allotted, it would be helpful to create these tables for each category of campaigns and analyze the trends across all the data we have.
